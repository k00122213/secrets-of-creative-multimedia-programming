`<h1>Web Development</h1> 

<h2 class="heading2">Overview</h2>
<p> Web development broadly refers to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or Internet. The Web development process includes Web design, Web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks ( <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23889/web-development" target="_blank">source</a> ).
</p>
<p>
This module is integral to learning how to build and design websites. It covers the basics such as HTML and CSS which are the foundations of building and designing websites. It also teaches you how to push your website on to github and make changes etc. This is one of the most important subjects of the first semester as every other subject builds on the core curriculum of this module.

		<h3 class="heading3">Continuous Assessment</h3>
		<p>There is no end of semester final exams for this module and all marks are obtained through continuous assessment that is made up of projects/assignments and short moodle quizzes.</p>
        <h3 class="heading3">Links to blogs/websites</h3>
		<p>As part of some modules and assignments we were required to make and maintain a blog. The link to my web development blog is <a href="http://k00122213webdev.blogspot.ie/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<p> I also have a sample of the final assignment for Web Development that was uploaded to github <a href="https://k00122213.github.io/WebDevelopment/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		<h3 class="heading3">Insiders Hints and Tips</h3>
		<p>This is an important subject to get the hang of as it teaches you the basics of web development and its the only way to get started with building websites. I suggest starting any projects as soon as you get them and using Lynda.com and w3schools to continue your study at home.
		If you put the time and effort into practicing your use of HTML and CSS then you will have less of a struggle with more advanced web development in the second semester.</p>

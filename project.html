`<h1>Multimedia Project</h1> 

<h2 class="heading2">Overview</h2>
<p>The entire module is a final year multimedia project. Its objectives for 2016/17 were determined by the <a href="http://sda.thersa.org/en/challenge/rsa-student-design-awards-2017/phase/rsa-student-design-awards-2017/tracks" target="_blank">RSA's Student Design Awards</a> Briefs. There were many to choose from
. I chose Number 12 called 'Moving Pictures' that involved creating an animation and a website to feature the animation.

		<h3 class="heading3">Continuous Assessment</h3>
		<p>The entire module is one big project but there are deadlines and deliverables such as a proposal report, research report, presentations and demonstrations. You are also required to complete a report.</p>
        <h3 class="heading3">Links to blogs/websites</h3>
		<p>As 10% of our grade is allocated to blogging about our process, I maintain mine every time i finish something new. You can visit my <a href="http://k00122213project.blogspot.ie/" target="_blank">blogger</a> account to view my progress. It is still currently being updated.</p>
		<h3 class="heading3">Insiders Hints and Tips</h3>
		<p>Timing is everything with this module. Try and accurately determine how long tasks will take. Also, choose a project that interests you. You will spend so much time doing it so its best to do something you enjoy or make something about what you enjoy.</p>
